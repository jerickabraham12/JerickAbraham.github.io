Lets talk about Koalas
</p >
 <p>  Koalas are not bears. They are not placental or 'eutherian' mammals, but MARSUPIALS, 
 which means that their young are born immature & they develop further in the safety of a pouch.
 It’s incorrect to call them ‘Koala bears' - their correct name is simply 'Koalas'.Habitat loss is 
 the greatest threat to Koalas. The main reasons for this are land clearing, bushfires and diseases 
 of the eucalypts, like ‘dieback' which cause the trees to die. The AKF wants a Koala Protection Act,
 which means that Koala trees can’t be touched.The AKF estimates that there are likely to be less than
 80,000 Koalas remaining in Australia today and it could be as low as 43,000. Much of their habitat has
 already been lost. This makes it vitally important to save what is left. Koalas have 5 digits on each 
 front paw, two of which are opposed to the others, much like our thumbs are able to be moved differently 
 from the fingers. This helps them to hold firmly onto the branches and to grip their food. The 2nd and 3rd
 digits on their hind paws are fused together to form a grooming claw. Koalas are mostly nocturnal. Nocturnal
 animals are awake at night and asleep during the day. Koalas, however, sleep for part of the night and also 
 sometimes move about in the daytime. They often sleep for up to 18-20 hours each day. An adult koala eats about 
 1/2 - 1 kilogram of leaves each night. There is a myth that Koalas sleep a lot because they ‘get drunk’ on gumleaves.
 Fortunately, this is not correct! Most of their time is spent sleeping because it requires a lot of energy to digest 
 their toxic, fibrous, low-nutrition diet and sleeping is the best way to conserve energy. Koalas in the southern part
 of Australia are considerably larger and have thicker fur than those in the north.This is thought to 
 be an adaptation to keep them warm in the colder southern winters. Koalas in the southern parts of Australia
